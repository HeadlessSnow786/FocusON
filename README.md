# FocusON

**FocusON** is a productivity and attention monitoring tool that uses webcam-based gaze tracking, blink analysis, and AI-powered screenshot analysis to help users stay focused and productive.

- **Eye Contact Monitoring:** Notifies you if you look away from the screen for more than 5 seconds.
- **Productivity Screenshot Analysis:** Takes a screenshot every 30 seconds and uses ChatGPT (GPT-4 Vision) to determine if you are on a productive or non-productive website/application.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Displays messages and alerts directly on the video feed.
